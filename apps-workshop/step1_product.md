## Introducing our sample application

We have a twitter-like application where users can submit status updates in a stream.

[View the app here](https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-3001-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com)

**Workshop goals**

We would like to have a system that allows us to connect to an internal API and take action on accounts.
A very simple action could be rate limiting calls to GET APIs, or blocking submission due to spam.
